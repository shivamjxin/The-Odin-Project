    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    You need just five ingredients (plus some warm water) to make this super simple pizza crust.
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Yeast</strong><br>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast. <br>Active dry yeast is a leavening agent, which means it's the ingredient that causes the pizza dough to rise.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar</strong><br>1 teaspoon white sugar. <br>To activate your yeast, you'll need to dissolve it in warm water with a teaspoon of sugar. The sugar gives the yeast something to eat and speeds up the <a href="https://greatist.com/eat/how-to-activate-yeast#:~:text=Dry%20yeast%20is%20the%20most,makes%20cakes%20and%20bread%20rise." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>activation process.</i></a> You'll know your yeast is active when it becomes bubbly and frothy on top.</li>
        <li><strong>Bread Flour</strong><br>2 Â½ cups bread flour<br>Bread flour is ideal for pizza crust because it creates chewier results than all-purpose flour. This is because it contains more protein, which helps produce lots of gluten. Gluten is what gives the crust elasticity.</li>
        <li><strong>Olive Oil</strong><br>2 tablespoons olive oil<br>Olive oil serves a couple purposes when it comes to pizza crust: Not only does it add color and flavor, but it creates a barrier between the oil and water. This oily barrier prevents sogginess.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt</strong><br>1 teaspoon salt<br>A little bit of salt goes a long way. Salt adds flavor, strengthens the gluten (creating a chewier crust), and slows down fermentation (resulting in a better rise).</li>
        <li><strong>1 cup warm water</strong> (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C), and lightly grease a pizza pan.</li>
        <li>Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar. Mix and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to make it easier.</li>
        <li>Let rest for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle.</li>
        <li>Transfer to the prepared pizza pan.</li>
        <li>Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
